A type of API which follows these rules:-
//Rules 



                Request
    CLIENT  ---------------> SERVER
            <---------------
                Response
1)Client -> browser, phone, any technical device
2) Works on server-client architexture . Server and client are different machines , Both must be indepedent of each other
3) Response -> can be text, image, html document(SSR:Server Side Rendering) , JSON(javascript object Notation)(key-value pair->raw data)
4) Always respect all http methods -> GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE 

//Right 
GET /user -> user data read kro and return  data
POST /user -> Handle new user Creation
PATCH /user -> Update the user 

//Wrong => Because POST is meant to send data => For updating data PUT and PATCH is used. Similarly to get data GET  is used. and to delete dat DELETE is used
POST /updateUser -> Update the user POST /createUser -> Create the user 
POST /deleteUSer -> delete the user


CSR ->Client Side Rendering -> JSON  
SSR ->Server Side Rendering -> HTML
