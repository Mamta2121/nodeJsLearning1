-> Every middleware has access to next() function , which calls next midddleware

->If there exist a next middleware after the current middleware , you should either end the cycle by sending the response from current middleware , or should use next() to call next middleware .
->If you don't use either the request get stuck at current middleware

->Why Use next()?

To Pass Control:next() tells Express to move to the next middleware function in the stack. Without calling next(), the request will not proceed further, and the response will hang (timeout).
Skipping Middleware:You can use next('route') to skip the current middleware and jump to the next route handler if the conditions are met.
